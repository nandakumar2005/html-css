   schools, college and workspaces are stoped. On that time we and my friends played video games and outdoor games on my street. and 11th std fully went on pandamic no study
   only play games,sleep well and watch tv proggram. and last two month only we went to school. but after govrnment announced this year 10th 11th and 12th all students were all pass. that was crazy.
